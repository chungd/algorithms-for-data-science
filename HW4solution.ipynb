    "Recall that a flow network with demands consists of a directed graph $G = (V, E)$, where each edge $(i,j) \\in E$ has a positive integer capacity $c_{ij}$ and each node $i \\in V$ has an integer demand $d_i$. In a *min-cost flow* problem, each edge $(i,j) \\in E$ also has a cost (or weight) $w_{ij}$. (Note that this input generalizes the input to two important problems we discussed so far: in max flow, the edge weights were not important while in shortest paths, the edge capacities were not important.) \n",
    "\n",
    "Given a flow network with capacities and costs, the goal is to find a *feasible* flow $f: E \\rightarrow R^+$ --that is, a flow satisfying edge capacity constraints and node demands-- that minimizes the total cost of the flow. Explicitly, the problem can be formulated as a linear program."

    "\n",
    "To implement your reduction from Problem 1 in HW4-theoretical, you will work with some standard benchmark instances for min-cost flow found [here](http://elib.zib.de/pub/Packages/mp-testdata/mincost/gte/index.html). The format of the data is described in the [Info](http://elib.zib.de/pub/Packages/mp-testdata/mincost/gte/info) file. You are to read in the graph from the data file in a form that can be solved using NetworkX's `min_cost_flow` function. Note that the data sometimes lists multiple edges between the same nodes, but with different costs or capacities. In forming the graph, you need to implement your reduction from the previous question and form a `DiGraph` instance, because the `min_cost_flow` function cannot handle multi-edges, even though the package offers `MultiDiGraph` objects."
